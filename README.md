Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to map out the relationships between characters in a set of documents (novel, series of novels, history chronicle, etc.)

Here is a link to my blog post with more information:   https://lichtphyz.github.io/Mapping-Character-Interactions-using-NLP-(and-d3.ds)/

and here is a short [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQI12pBd5YJu_Un6LCz_z0nfKutBcjuttQeyLiNrsyORLuqkFzbiMVg5jW4Rlhzz8RB-KTBwi-KJXsj/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000&slide=id.g35f391192_04) I did on the project.
